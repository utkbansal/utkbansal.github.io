So lets go back three years in time... I had just stumbled across this cool programming language called `Python`,
playing around with `Django` and this is where it all started.

I had this itch to do something cool - something that a lot of people used. So in my pursuit of fame, I kept looking 
for what I could do until I rediscovered **Mozilla** - the guys that build Firefox(among the other cool things). Turns 
out that most of their code is open source and their sites run on Django. Cool!

There was no stopping for me, I jumped right in and found a very tiny(read: insignificant) [bug](https://
bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1122937) - changing the hex color 
code in the site footer of mozilla.org. I went ahead and fixed it and it got merged into the main codebase. That is a 
moment I remember till date - I wrote code that was being run by thousands of people everyday. I had my name in 
the list of contributors on Github and one of their code developers - pmac also wrote about it on his [blog](https://
pmac.io/2015/02/state-of-mozilla-org/).

That feeling of awesomeness stuck with me and I kept contributing small fixes here and there to a couple more 
organizations. Fast forwarding to today, I have been selected for [**Google Summer of Code(GSoC)**](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5803653609816064) to work with [**MDAnalysis**](http://www.mdanalysis.org/) to modernize and improve the performance of their testsuite.

So for the next couple of months I'll be collaborating with the cool folks at MDAnalysis and carve out some cool bits
of code. I'll be basically be doing a major overhaull of their testing framework to make it faster and more 
maintainable. You'll surely get to hear about it in the near future!
