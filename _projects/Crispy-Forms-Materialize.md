As a backend developer myself, I don't really like writing CSS and tweaking it for hours to make it look pixel perfect 
and make it work accross all screen sizes perfectly. Moreover I found while using a CSS framework (Bootstrap/MaterializeCSS) I am repeating myself over and over again writing the same CSS rules for different forms.

So here's what I did, I built a library for Django to design forms in HTML using MaterializeCSS. The library defines template widgets for every form field which **reduces the long HTML/ CSS code for a form to a single line of Django template code**.
Yes you read it correct, a single line of template code to render the complete form using MaterializeCSS!
